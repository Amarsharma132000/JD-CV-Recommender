        "# JD-CV Recommendation System: Project Report\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Project Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "The JD-CV Recommendation System aims to match job seekers (represented by their CVs or online profiles) with relevant job descriptions (JDs). The system leverages a multi-stage approach to first identify a pool of potential candidates and then rank them based on their relevance to a given JD.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project is broken down into three main steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **JD Parsing**: This initial step involves extracting key information from a job description. The output of this stage includes a bag of keywords related to the job, the specific job role, required experience, and location. While the provided notebook doesn't explicitly show the JD parsing code, it's listed as a foundational step, implying that the system assumes parsed JD data as input for the subsequent stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Candidate Pool Generation**: This stage focuses on finding a initial set of potential candidates. The current implementation utilizes Google X-Ray search (simulated via the `serpapi` library) with pagination to collect LinkedIn profile URLs based on a specified query (e.g., `\"QA Automation\" \"5 years\" \"India\" site:linkedin.com/in`). This method effectively generates a list of publicly available LinkedIn profiles matching the initial broad criteria. The notebook then saves these URLs to a text file for further processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **JD-CV Recommender**: This is the core of the recommendation system. It takes the collected LinkedIn profile URLs and a job role as input to generate a ranked list of candidates. The provided code demonstrates the use of the SignalHire API to enrich the collected LinkedIn URLs with detailed profile data (position, skills, summary). This enriched data is then used by the `JobRoleMatcher` class, which employs a hybrid approach combining:\n",
        "    *   **Semantic Similarity (using Sentence Embeddings)**: The `SentenceTransformer` model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) is used to create numerical representations (embeddings) of the candidate's resume text (derived from position, skills, and summary) and the target job role. Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) is used to efficiently find candidates with semantically similar profiles to the job role query.\n",
        "    *   **Keyword Matching (using BM25)**: The BM25Okapi algorithm is used to calculate a score based on the presence and frequency of keywords extracted from the job description (both raw keywords and N-grams) within the candidate's resume text.\n",
        "    *   **Weighted Scoring**: A final AI Score is calculated as a weighted sum of the semantic similarity score, the BM25 keyword score, and a direct keyword match score. The weights (`a`, `b`, and `c`) are configurable, allowing for tuning the importance of each component in the final ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `JobRoleMatcher` preprocesses the text data by removing special characters, tokenizing, removing stop words, and lemmatizing to ensure effective matching. The scores are then scaled to a target range (88-94 in the example) and the candidates are ranked based on this final AI Score.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Tech Stack\n",
        "\n",
        "The project utilizes a combination of Python libraries and external APIs to achieve its functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.\n",
        "*   **`google-search-results` (SerpApi)**: Used to perform Google X-Ray searches to gather LinkedIn profile URLs. This library interfaces with the SerpApi service.\n",
        "*   **`pyngrok`**: Used to create a secure tunnel to the local callback server in the Colab environment, allowing the SignalHire API to send data back.\n",
        "*   **`requests`**: Used for making HTTP requests, primarily to the SignalHire API for profile enrichment.\n",
        "*   **`pandas`**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling the profile data in a structured DataFrame format.\n",
        "*   **`numpy`**: Used for numerical operations, likely within the sentence embedding and similarity calculations.\n",
        "*   **`scikit-learn`**: A machine learning library, although its specific use is not explicitly shown in the provided code beyond general machine learning concepts being applied.\n",
        "*   **`annoy`**: Used for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search on the sentence embeddings, speeding up the process of finding similar candidate profiles.\n",
        "*   **`rank-bm25`**: An implementation of the BM25 algorithm for keyword matching and scoring.\n",
        "*   **`nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization. The notebook shows downloads for `punkt_tab`, `stopwords`, and `wordnet`.\n",
        "*   **`transformers` (Hugging Face)**: While imported, its direct use for model loading is abstracted by the `sentence-transformers` library in the provided code. It likely provides the underlying framework for the sentence embedding model.\n",
        "*   **`torch` (PyTorch)**: A deep learning framework, used by the `sentence-transformers` library for running the sentence embedding model.\n",
        "*   **`sentence-transformers`**: A library specifically for generating sentence embeddings, simplifying the use of pre-trained transformer models for this purpose. The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model is used.\n",
        "*   **`scipy`**: Used for scientific and technical computing, specifically for the cosine similarity calculation in the `JobRoleMatcher`.\n",
        "*   **SignalHire API**: An external service used to enrich LinkedIn profile URLs with detailed candidate data (position, skills, summary, etc.). This is a crucial component for obtaining the information needed for the recommendation engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Deliverable Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the current notebook and the implemented approach, the project is capable of delivering the following results:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **A ranked list of candidates for a given job role**: The core output is a pandas DataFrame containing candidate profiles sorted by a calculated `AI_Score`. This score represents the system's assessment of how well each candidate matches the provided job role based on semantic similarity, keyword matching, and direct keyword presence.\n",
        "*   **Candidate profile data**: The system successfully retrieves enriched candidate data from LinkedIn profiles using the SignalHire API. This includes key information like position, skills, and a summary, which are essential for evaluating candidate fit.\n",
        "*   **Insights into matching factors**: The `JobRoleMatcher` class calculates and includes individual scores for `role_similarity_score`, `bm25_score`, and `keyword_score` in the output DataFrame. This provides transparency into why a candidate received a particular AI Score, indicating whether the match is primarily due to semantic similarity of the role, keyword relevance, or direct keyword hits. This can be valuable for recruiters to understand the basis of the recommendation.\n",
        "*   **Scalable candidate search**: The use of Google X-Ray search with pagination allows for generating a candidate pool of a specified size (up to 100 in the example, but can be adjusted), demonstrating the system's ability to handle a potentially large number of candidates.\n",
        "*   **Profile data enrichment**: The integration with the SignalHire API enables the extraction of detailed information from public LinkedIn profiles, which is often more structured and comprehensive than what might be available from simply parsing publicly visible web pages.\n",
        "*   **Downloadable results**: The notebook includes functionality to save the retrieved profile data (both intermediate and final successful results) as JSON files and offers the ability to download these files, making the extracted data available for further analysis or integration with other systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system effectively combines broad search capabilities with a nuanced ranking mechanism based on both semantic understanding and keyword relevance, providing a more intelligent approach to candidate recommendation than simple keyword matching alone. The configurable weighting of scoring components allows for tailoring the recommendations to specific needs or priorities."
